# Instruction to use

You can add ~dibmet-narren or ~talsyx-talsud for some existing adverts on live network.

If you just added a pal (after installing the app), Click on the sync button in top right corner to update the subscription to pals

You can create new advert to request or offer a service or goods.

Home page shows any existing adverts posted in your network i.e. by your pals or pals of pals.

You can click on advert card to view more full details. The advert page features are markdown renderer which supports rendering images, vedios and 3D models (.glb files).

On advert page client has option to express intent towards the goods/service or to intitiate chat with the vendor for more details.

If an advert seems naughty the user can down-vote by clicking down arrow. This will delete the ad from our ship and also stop broadcasting it to our pals. This enables peer censorship of in-appropriate content.

After the client has expressed intent in an advert, vendor gets the notification. Vendor than has option to commit to transact with client or ignore it. The transaction can be completed and coordinated between party using direct chat and external payment processing.

Both parties can submit review only after the vendor commit. *Tip to user: Do not exchange value until vendor has committed*

Each advert page shows the reviews on the advert and also the past reviews for that vendor. So, even when a vendor deletes a malicious advert, the negative reviews sticks around.

On the top right corner you click the sigil avatar to see your profile with past ads, reviews for and by you.

On advert page as well as review cards one can click to redirect to the given ship's profile [/apps/bizbaz/profile/~<ship>] to see their past ads and review
